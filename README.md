# LGS_ARX
The Logitech|G Arx Control Software Development Kit enables applications such as games to interact with the Arx Control app on mobile devices.

Arx Control allows games and third party developers to take advantage of an iOS/Android device as a secondary screen to display useful data from the game.

# SDK Package
The following files are included:

● LogitechGArxControlLib.h: C/C++ header file containing function prototypes

● LogitechGArxControlLib.lib: companion lib file to access DLL exported functions (32 and 64 bit)

# Requirements
The Logitech|G Arx Control SDK can be used on the following platforms:

● Windows Vista (32-bit and 64-bit)
● Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit)
● Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit)

Logitech Gaming Software (8.52 or higher) needs to be running in order to use this SDK.
The SDK is a Windows based API for C/C++ programmers. The applet layout is based on web programming, so a basic knowledge of HTML/JavaScript/CSS is also needed.
